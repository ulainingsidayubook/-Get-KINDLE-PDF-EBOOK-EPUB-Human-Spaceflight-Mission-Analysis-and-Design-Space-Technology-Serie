Title: The single most useful book I've found for spacecraft and mission design.
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2005
Review: As a graduate student in space architecture, this is the single most useful book I have found for designing human missions and spacecraft. It is an extraordinary collection of valuable information.

Part textbook, part reference manual, the book includes both descriptive text and a wealth of numerical data. It is broken up into 31 chapters, each about 20 to 30 pages long. Each chapter focuses on one aspect of human spaceflight, such as structures, power systems, crew accommodations, or planetary surface vehicles, and each is written by one or more experts in the relevant field.

Although the book is designed for people who work with spacecraft for a living, it is very accessible. Anyone with a good grasp of algebra and a strong interest in spaceflight should be able to follow most of it.

If I could change one thing about this book, it would be to make it a hardbound edition. My copy is rapidly becoming dog-eared. It's just so blasted useful...
